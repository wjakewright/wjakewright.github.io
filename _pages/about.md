I am currently a postdoctoral fellow mentored by Dr. Takaki Komiyama at the University of California, San Deigo, where I investigate how natural activity patterns shape various forms of synaptic plasticity and how this plasticity in turn reorganizes neural circuits to mediate learning. Prior to joining the Komiyama lab at UCSD, I recieved my PhD in Neuroscience from the University of Pittsburgh, where I worked with Dr. Yan Dong to study the synaptic mechanisms that underlie the natural dynamcis of drug-associated memories. 

My long-term goal is to understand how the brain adaptively encodes information to shape behavior in both health and disease. I am particularly interested in understanding how lower-level modifications, such as changes in synaptic function, drive higher-level adaptations in circuit function to obtain a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how the brain adaptively controls behavior. Broadly, I intend to focus my research on understanding how specific dendritic and synaptic properties influence neural function and plasticity to underlie neural computations and how these different properties may contribute to the development of neuropsychiatric conditions.
