Synaptic plasticity underlies learning by modifying specific synaptic inputs to reshape neural activity
and behavior. However, the rules governing which synapses will undergo different forms of plasticity
in vivo during learning and whether these rules are uniform within individual neurons remain unclear.
Using in vivo longitudinal imaging with single-synapse resolution in the mouse motor cortex during motor
learning, we found that apical and basal dendrites of layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons showed distinct
activity-dependent synaptic plasticity rules. The strengthening of apical and of basal synapses is
predicted by local coactivity with nearby synapses and activity coincident with postsynaptic action
potentials, respectively. Blocking postsynaptic spiking diminished basal synaptic potentiation without
affecting apical plasticity. Thus, individual neurons use multiple activity-dependent plasticity rules
in a compartment-specific manner in vivo during learning.
